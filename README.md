# NormCompressAI
Image Compression using Norm-Based Loss Functions

## Objective
The goal is to compress images using a deep learning model (autoencoder) and apply different norms (L1, L2, and L-infinity) as loss functions to measure reconstruction error. We will then evaluate how these norms affect the quality and efficiency of the compression.
